<p><strong>XPolicyLab: A unified standard and infrastructure for robot policy development and deployment.</strong></p>

</div>

XPolicyLab is the shared layer between policy code and evaluation environments. Keep each model's dependencies, checkpoints, and training recipes under `policy/<POLICY>/`; XPolicyLab handles the parts that are boring but easy to get wrong — serving, observation/action contracts, and eval wiring.

Start here for repo-level concepts and integration steps. For install commands, checkpoint layout, and training details, jump to that policy's README — it is the source of truth for its model.

## 🚀 What XPolicyLab Enables

- **Environment isolation**: run the policy model in its own conda/uv environment while the simulator, benchmark, or robot client runs separately.
- **Remote deployment**: connect the policy server and environment client through websocket, either on one machine or across machines.
- **A common adapter contract**: use the same high-level lifecycle for installation, data conversion, training, serving, and evaluation.
- **A large policy zoo**: reuse adapters for VLA/WAM policies, imitation-learning baselines, and reference templates.
- **Benchmark and infra integration**: mount XPolicyLab into benchmark or simulator workspaces without coupling policy code to one environment.

## 🌐 Supported Benchmarks And Infrastructure

**Benchmarks**

- **[RoboDojo](https://github.com/RoboDojo-Benchmark/RoboDojo)**: simulator-backed evaluation and RoboDojo-format data exports.
- **[RoboTwin](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin)**: benchmark and data source through policy-specific adapters and conversion scripts.

**Infrastructure**

- **[RLinf](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf)**: infrastructure target for policy development and deployment workflows.
- **StarVLA**: infrastructure and policy stack; see [policy/starVLA](policy/starVLA/README.md).

## 🧭 Integrated Policies

Top-level adapters live in `policy/`. Each policy README documents that model's paper/repo link, environment, data format, training entrypoint, and checkpoint layout.

## 📤 Submit Your Policy

Community policies are welcome — open a PR that adds `policy/<POLICY>/`. A PR is also **required** to enter the official [RoboDojo](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard) and [RoboTwin](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/leaderboard) leaderboards, together with the checkpoint that reproduces your results. The full adapter standard, testing steps, and PR description template live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

PR rules:

1. **Follow the standard adapter layout** ([Framework Overview](#-framework-overview)) and support the full lifecycle — install, data conversion, training, and eval. If the training code cannot be open-sourced yet, you may land eval-only support first: notify the maintainers ([Contact](#-contact)) and share a timeline for releasing training.
2. **Write the policy README** so that environment setup, data, training, and eval all work by following the script and argument conventions in [Common Workflow](#-common-workflow).
3. **Run the closed loop locally first** — at minimum the debug-mode eval in [Checks](#-checks), ideally a simulator-backed eval.
4. **For official leaderboard evaluation**, attach a checkpoint download script in the PR description (Hugging Face or ModelScope preferred). We will evaluate your submission and publish the leaderboard entry as soon as possible.

## 🧩 Framework Overview

XPolicyLab separates model-side dependencies from environment-side dependencies.

```text
Policy environment                         Evaluation / benchmark environment
------------------                         ----------------------------------
policy/<POLICY>/model.py     <---ws--->    env client / simulator / robot
policy server                              environment client
deploy.yml runtime config                  benchmark task and observation API
```

A typical adapter contains:

```text
policy/<POLICY>/
├── README.md                    # policy-specific guide
├── INSTALLATION.md              # optional detailed setup notes
├── install.sh                   # environment setup
├── process_data.sh              # optional data conversion
├── train.sh                     # optional training
├── eval.sh                      # same-machine evaluation
├── setup_eval_policy_server.sh  # policy-side server
├── setup_eval_env_client.sh     # environment-side client
├── deploy.yml                   # runtime config
├── deploy.py                    # evaluation loop
└── model.py                     # model adapter
```

`model.py` implements the model-facing API. `deploy.py` bridges environment observations to model-server calls. Use [policy/demo_policy](policy/demo_policy/README.md) as the minimal adapter reference.

`model.py` should define a `Model` class with this shape:

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `__init__(model_cfg)` | Load model config, checkpoints, processors, and runtime overrides from `deploy.yml`. |
| `update_obs(obs)` | Update model state from one observation dictionary. |
| `update_obs_batch(obs_list)` | Update model state from a list of observation dictionaries. |
| `get_action()` | Return one action chunk as a list of action dictionaries. |
| `get_action_batch(env_idx_list=None)` | Return batched action chunks aligned with active environment indices. |
| `reset()` | Clear model-side state between evaluation episodes. It takes no arguments — a policy that needs a first observation should `reset()` and then take a normal `update_obs`. |

The policy server decodes camera colors before `update_obs` / `update_obs_batch`, so `obs["vision"][<camera>]["color"]` always arrives as an image array — `model.py` never decodes.

The default policy-server protocol is websocket (`protocol: ws` in `deploy.yml`); `legacy_tcp` exists only for adapters that have not migrated yet. The transport handles reconnects, retries, keepalive, and long model-loading cold starts for you — a normal adapter never touches it.

<details>
<summary>Transport details and timeout tuning (only if evaluation hangs or drops)</summary>

- **Retries are safe**: each request carries a `request_id` that the client reuses across reconnects, and the server answers duplicates from a cache instead of running a non-idempotent call twice. A `timeout` error is the exception — the server may still be running the call, so treat it as fatal for that trial rather than retrying.
- **Server restarts abort the run**: if a reconnect lands on a different server process, the client raises `ServerRestartedError`, because the fresh server lost the model state.
- **Cold start**: the server loads the model before opening its port, so an early client just retries (default budget 15 min). `eval.sh` also gates the client behind `wait_for_policy_server.sh`.
- **Errors**: the client only sees `str(exc)`; the full traceback of a model failure is logged on the *policy server* side, so look there first.
- **Serialization** is msgpack with numpy support (`torch.Tensor` auto-converts). Three quirks: `tuple` arrives as `list`, decoded numpy arrays are read-only views (copy before in-place edits), and int dict keys arrive as strings.

Optional `deploy.yml` keys — omit them to keep the defaults:

| Key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request_timeout_s` | `120.0` | Timeout for one `update_obs` / `get_action` call — raise it for slow inference. |
| `max_connect_attempts` | `180` | Cold-start retries while the server is still loading. |
| `connect_retry_delay_s` | `5.0` | Delay between those retries. |
| `max_connect_seconds` | `900.0` | Wall-clock cap on the whole retry loop; `0` disables it. |
| `connect_timeout_s` | `30.0` | Timeout for one connect attempt. |
| `handshake_timeout_s` | `60.0` | Timeout for the HELLO round-trip. |
| `ws_ping_interval_s` / `ws_ping_timeout_s` | `20.0` | Keepalive ping/pong; `null` disables. |
| `close_timeout_s` | `10.0` | Cap on the closing handshake. |

## 🛠️ Model Integration Guide

The fastest way to add a model is to copy the reference adapter, keep the XPolicyLab boundary small, and debug the adapter before touching a real simulator.

1. **Learn the reference adapter**: read [policy/demo_policy](policy/demo_policy/README.md), especially `model.py`, `deploy.py`, `deploy.yml`, `eval.sh`, `setup_eval_policy_server.sh`, and `setup_eval_env_client.sh`.
2. **Understand the arguments**: keep `bench_name`, `task_name`, `ckpt_name`, `env_cfg_type`, `action_type`, and `seed` consistent across data, training, and eval.
3. **Create a skeleton**: run `bash scripts/create_policy.sh <POLICY_NAME>` and immediately fill in `policy/<POLICY_NAME>/README.md`.
4. **Implement `model.py` first**: load model resources in `__init__`, store observations in `update_obs`, translate observations to model-native inputs, return XPolicyLab action dictionaries from `get_action`, and reset state in `reset`.
5. **Keep deployment simple**: put runtime defaults in `deploy.yml`; keep `deploy.py` aligned with `demo_policy/deploy.py` unless the environment loop truly differs.
6. **Debug without a simulator**: run `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug` to check imports, server startup, observation serialization, action keys, action dimensions, and batch logic.
7. **Move to simulator or remote deployment**: after debug mode passes, use `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` or split policy server and environment client across machines.

<summary>Using a coding agent</summary>

This repo ships Cursor Agent Skills under [.cursor/skills](.cursor/skills): `xpolicylab-model-integration` builds an adapter (a prompt like "Integrate <POLICY_NAME> into XPolicyLab" is enough), and `xpolicylab-adapter-check` audits one against [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before a PR ("Check policy/<POLICY_NAME>"). Cursor picks them up automatically. For other agents, paste this checklist:

```text
Integrate <POLICY_NAME> into XPolicyLab.

Use policy/demo_policy as the reference.
1. Inspect the upstream model's inference API and dependencies.
2. Create or update policy/<POLICY_NAME>/README.md with install, checkpoint, train, and eval commands.
3. Implement install.sh and, if needed, process_data.sh and train.sh.
4. Implement model.py with Model.__init__, update_obs, get_action, reset, and batch methods.
5. Keep deploy.py aligned with policy/demo_policy/deploy.py.
6. Put runtime defaults in deploy.yml and use protocol: ws.
7. Run EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug eval.sh and fix shape/action-key/server errors.
8. Summarize supported action_type, env_cfg_type, checkpoint layout, and remaining limitations.
```

</details>

## ⚡ Quick Start

Clone XPolicyLab as a normal Python project for adapter development, offline checks, training from prepared data, or your own environment client:

```bash
mkdir demo_env
cd demo_env
git clone https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab.git
cd XPolicyLab
pip install -e .
```

You do not need a simulator to start model-side development: the bundled downloader fetches prepared RoboDojo data — several simulator export versions plus HDF5 `RoboDojo_real` real-world data — for training and offline debugging. If you use `XPolicyLab/` as a subpackage inside the RoboDojo repository, follow RoboDojo's own data download scripts instead.

Download a small Hugging Face demo bundle and keep the data next to `XPolicyLab/`:

```bash
# From demo_env/XPolicyLab
bash scripts/RoboDojo/download_robodojo_data.sh demo
```

This creates:

```text
demo_env/
├── data/        # demo data, including a small 10-episode HuggingFace bundle
└── XPolicyLab/
```

The same script pulls the full exports — `hdf5`, `lerobot_v3.0`, `lerobot_v2.1`, and `real` (real-world HDF5) — each into its own `../data/` folder.

With this setup, you can test data conversion, model loading, training scripts, and debug-mode evaluation before connecting to a simulator-backed benchmark.

```bash
export EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug
cd policy/demo_policy
bash install.sh
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls demo arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 base base
```

The template for any adapter is the same — swap `demo_policy` and the argument values:

```bash
export EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug
cd policy/<POLICY>
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> \
  <seed> <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_env_or_uv_path> <eval_env_conda_env>
```

For RoboDojo simulation, mount `XPolicyLab/` beside the simulator-side `env_cfg/`, `scripts/`, `src/eval_client/`, and `task/` directories.

## 🔄 Common Workflow

Most adapters expose the same top-level shape. Some policies add extra arguments, consume upstream-native datasets, or skip training support. Follow the policy README when it differs from this template.

```bash
cd policy/<POLICY>

# Install the policy runtime.
bash install.sh

# Optional: convert or prepare policy-specific data.
bash process_data.sh <bench_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> [extra_args...]

# Optional: train.
bash train.sh <bench_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> <gpu_id> [extra_args...]

# Evaluate on one machine.
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_env_or_uv_path> <eval_env_conda_env>
```

### What the arguments mean

When you run `eval.sh`, you are mostly answering: **which benchmark family**, **which task to run now**, **which checkpoint to load**, **which robot setup**, **joint or end-effector actions**, and **which seed**. The same names travel through `process_data.sh`, `train.sh`, and `eval.sh`, so you do not have to rename things at every step.

| Argument | In plain English | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bench_name` | Which benchmark or dataset family this run belongs to | `RoboDojo`, `RoboTwin` |
| `task_name` | The task the environment client should run right now | `stack_bowls`, `push_T` — can differ from the tasks seen during training |
| `ckpt_name` | Which weights to load: a short run nickname, the full run folder name, or a path | `cotrain`, `RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0`, `checkpoints/my_run/` |
| `env_cfg_type` | Robot / camera / scene configuration key | `arx_x5` |
| `action_type` | Action space the policy outputs | usually `joint` or `ee` |
| `seed` | Training or evaluation seed / layout id | `0`, `1`, `2` |
| `policy_gpu_id` / `env_gpu_id` | Which GPU runs the model vs. the simulator/client | `0`, `1` |
| `policy_env_or_uv_path` | Conda env name or uv env path for the policy server | your policy-side env |
| `eval_env_conda_env` | Conda env for the simulator / robot client | your eval-side env |

**How `ckpt_name` resolves.** Usually you pass the short nickname used during training, such as `cotrain`, and XPolicyLab combines it with the other args into `checkpoints/RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0/`. You can also pass the full folder name, or a path — relative paths resolve from the policy directory, absolute paths work too. Some adapters honor explicit keys in `deploy.yml` (`checkpoint_path`, `model_path`, ...). When in doubt, check the policy README.

**A concrete eval example:**

```bash
cd policy/AHA_WAM
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls cotrain arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 aha_wam robodojo
# loads checkpoints/RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0/ and evaluates on stack_bowls
```

## 🔌 Deployment Flow

During evaluation, the policy server and the environment client talk over websocket. That split is what lets you keep Isaac Sim / robot drivers on one machine and a heavy VLA on another.

For same-machine evaluation, `eval.sh` is enough — it starts the server, runs the client, and cleans up when you are done.

For split-machine deployment, start the policy server on the GPU machine and bind to `0.0.0.0` so other machines can reach it. The client connects to the policy machine's real IP, not `0.0.0.0`.

```bash
cd policy/<POLICY>
bash setup_eval_policy_server.sh \
  <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <policy_env_or_uv_path> <policy_server_port> 0.0.0.0
```

Then start the environment client on the simulator or robot machine:

```bash
cd policy/<POLICY>
bash setup_eval_env_client.sh \
  <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <env_gpu_id> <eval_env_conda_env> <additional_info> \
  <policy_server_port> <policy_server_ip>
```

`<additional_info>` is a comma-separated `key=value` string forwarded to the environment client. `eval.sh` builds it automatically as `ckpt_name=<ckpt_name>,action_type=<action_type>`, which is the right default for most adapters.

`EVAL_ENV_TYPE` selects the environment-side backend:

- unset or `sim`: real simulator-backed evaluation, when the integration is installed.
- `debug`: offline wiring check — no Isaac, no robot, just shapes and IO.
- `real`: real-robot client path, where the hardware integration exists.

## 📐 Standard Data Formats

XPolicyLab standardizes the observation and trajectory dictionaries passed between adapters, converters, and environment clients. Individual policies may convert this standard format into their upstream-native format.

All pose values use `[x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz]`. Images are RGB end to end — stored image bits are encoded from RGB frames and no channel conversion happens anywhere in the pipeline (the only medium-adapter exceptions are listed with the converter helpers below). Note one naming quirk: runtime observations carry camera extrinsics as `extrinsics_matrix`, while trajectory files store `extrinsic_matrix`.

Useful converter helpers:

```python
from XPolicyLab.utils.load_file import load_hdf5
from XPolicyLab.utils.process_data import decode_image_bit, get_robot_action_dim_info
```

`decode_image_bit` turns encoded image streams into arrays and returns already-decoded values untouched. `get_robot_action_dim_info(env_cfg_type)` returns robot-specific `arm_dim` and `ee_dim` lists, so adapters do not need to hard-code action dimensions.

Three image rules that cause silent, hard-to-debug bugs when broken:

> - **`model.py` never decodes.** The policy server decodes every observation it forwards, so `obs["vision"][<camera>]["color"]` already is an image array. This covers `update_obs` / `update_obs_batch` and any custom RPC a policy exposes that carries an observation.
> - **Offline code decodes only via `decode_image_bit`.** In conversion scripts and training dataloaders, never hand-roll `cv2.imdecode` / `np.frombuffer` / PIL decoding — RoboTwin and RoboDojo store image bits in legacy layouts that only this function reads correctly.
> - **Everything is RGB, end to end.** No channel conversion belongs in conversion, training, or evaluation. The only exceptions are medium adapters: `COLOR_RGB2BGR` right before `cv2.VideoWriter.write(...)`, and `COLOR_BGR2RGB` right after `cv2.VideoCapture.read()`.

Robot action dimensions are registered in `utils/robot/_robot_info.json`: each top-level key is an `env_cfg_type` such as `arx_x5`, with `arm_dim` / `ee_dim` lists for per-arm joint and end-effector/gripper dimensions. Update it when adding a new robot configuration so conversion, training, and deployment code can infer action shapes consistently.

## 💾 Data And Checkpoints

Training and data prep usually name things predictably so eval can find them without guesswork:

```text
<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>
<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>
```

So if you trained with `bench_name=RoboDojo`, `ckpt_name=cotrain`, `env_cfg_type=arx_x5`, `action_type=joint`, `seed=0`, the run lands in `checkpoints/RoboDojo-cotrain-arx_x5-joint-0/`. How `ckpt_name` maps back to these folders at eval time is covered in [Common Workflow](#-common-workflow).

Policies may also use upstream-native layouts or explicit paths in `deploy.yml`. Check the policy README before assuming a naming convention. For a small local dataset to play with, see [Quick Start](#-quick-start).

## ✅ Checks

Static checks, from the XPolicyLab repo root:

```bash
git diff --check
bash -n policy/<POLICY>/*.sh
python -m py_compile policy/<POLICY>/model.py policy/<POLICY>/deploy.py
```

Adapter wiring check (no simulator required) — the same debug-mode eval as [Quick Start](#-quick-start), run from `policy/<POLICY>/`:

```bash
export EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls demo arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 \
  <policy_env_or_uv_path> <eval_env_conda_env>
```

The debug client sends plain image arrays by default. Re-run with `DEBUG_OBS_ENCODED=1` to make it send encoded camera colors instead — a JPEG buffer, raw bytes, and a plain array across the three cameras — which exercises the server-side decode path that real environment clients rely on.

For a quick smoke test, `policy/demo_policy` accepts placeholder env names such as `base`. Argument details live in [Common Workflow](#-common-workflow).
